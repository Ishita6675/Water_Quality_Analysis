 In the urban areas water is used for both industrial and domestic purposes from waterbodies such as rivers, lakes, streams, wells, and ponds. Worst still, 80% of the water that we use for our domestic purposes is passed out in the form of wastewater. In most of the cases, this water is not treated properly and as such it leads to tremendous pollution of surface-level freshwater.In fact as far as India is concerned polluted water is one of the major factors behind the general low levels of health in India, especially in the rural areas. Polluted water can lead to diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis, dysentery, jaundice, diarrhoea, etc. In fact, around 80% stomach ailments in India happen because of consuming polluted water.
